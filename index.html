        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration - AccountingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Nicholas Palencia. An upcoming Accounting student at UCR. I plan on joining one of the Big 4 right out of college and then going into the government after a few years. In the future, I want to own my own company and try to grow and expand. But first, I am interested in getting a position in an accounting firm. I would also like to earn my CPA and my realtor's license to help with my endeavors. I am dedicated to my job and I have never been late to a day of any job that I have had. I am good at analyzing numbers and organization. However, I am poor in interviews, making quality resumes, and explaining who I am. I hope to nurture these skills with the Career Development Program and make become a good interviewee so that I will have a better chance of obtaining a job in the future.<br><br>

           My qualifications extend from my own pursuit to own a company: to build something of my own. Iâ€™ve attempted to create multiple companies and the work I put in gave me experience, specifically in organization and financials. The two most significant positions I have had was my role as the Tenor Captain in my drumline and the role of the Vice President Of Finance within my virtual enterprise class. This position would benefit me greatly as I must understand the various positions and supporting roles of different departments within an organization/company but I also want to help ASUCR in their own organization of finances.
   My passion for business has led me to the attempted creation of multiple companies, and while all did not reach where they needed to be, I learned from my achievements and failures. One company had me learn how to make a budget for an upcoming music store. This endeavor required me to manage my home life differently as well as I was becoming busy with school and this upcoming business. I began my own system of home organization using a small calendar and a notebook to not only organize my thoughts but organize my time. This organization method I continue using to this day because it was very effective.<br><br>

           I continued my pursuit and found myself with the position of Vice President of Finance within my high school's Virtual Enterprise class. Virtual Enterprise is a class that mimics the creation of a company from scratch. The start consisted of creating budgets and persuading investors. Afterwards, it became more about managing where the money came from and where it went to. As the Vice President, I was also in charge of two other associates who I would assign tasks to help in the overall running of the company finances. 
    During my senior school year, I acquired my current job as the Accounting Intern at Empire Management Group. This job had me writing many reports such as income statements, balance sheets, general ledgers, overall reviews of the company compared to the budget, and key performance indicators on various doctors and employees. This gave me a solid understanding of the company, its vendors and an overall view of the company's financial picture which was important for management.
